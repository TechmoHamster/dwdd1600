    <h1>Inside the CarGuyz Garage</h1>

    <h2>Featured Build: Street-Friendly Mustang</h2>
    <p>
      This build focuses on a street-friendly setup with a balance of comfort and performance.
      The goal is to create a car that feels responsive and fun without becoming a harsh, unreliable daily driver.
    </p>

    <h2>Stage 1: Must-Have Tools</h2>
    <p>
      Before you start turning wrenches, make sure you have a few basic tools on hand. Having the right tools
      saves time, frustration, and sometimes your knuckles.
    </p>

    <!-- Unordered list -->
    <ul>
      <li>Jack and jack stands rated for your vehicle weight</li>
      <li>Metric and SAE socket set</li>
      <li>Torque wrench for critical bolts</li>
      <li>Shop light or headlamp</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Stage 2: Popular First Mods</h2>
    <p>
      Most enthusiasts begin with these simple but effective upgrades:
    </p>

    <!-- Ordered list -->
    <ol>
      <li>Performance exhaust for better sound and flow.</li>
      <li>Lowering springs or coilovers to improve handling.</li>
      <li>Upgraded brake pads and rotors for better stopping power.</li>
      <li>Wider, grippier tires to put power to the ground.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Garage Safety &amp; Etiquette</h2>
    <p>
      Safety in the garage is not optional. Always support the car correctly, keep your workspace organized,
      and never rush a job because you are tired. Your build will still be there tomorrow.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are new to working on cars, consider watching instructional videos from trusted creators on
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">YouTube</a> or reading guides on
      <a href="https://www.howstuffworks.com" target="_blank">HowStuffWorks</a>.
    </p>

    <!-- Example of inline emphasis and strong text -->
    <p>
      Remember, <strong>no build is worth getting hurt over</strong>. Take your time, double-check your work,
      and do not be afraid to ask for help from more experienced friends or local shops.
    </p>
